# ECE M202A Project - Auto-mapping of BLE beacons using IMU. 

## Motivation

Indoor positioning brings much value in many industry verticals. In warehouses, being able to navigate to an item or to a shelf can help save money and time. In hospitals, knowing the locations of equipment can save time and even save lives.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have been studied closely in the past decade as a cheap solution to indoor positioning. They have an accuracy range of about 1-2 meters, which is perfect for many office, warehouse, and large building settings. 

However, there are little to no solutions for locating the beacons. Once beacons are placed in their spot, the user will have to manually enter in the location of the beacons, which may not be accurate. 

What if there was a way to auto-map beacons once you set them down in their spots? What if you could generate a map of your beacons only with your phone? 


## Idea

There are 2 parts to my idea: 
1. I aim to use a phone's various sensors to locate and generate a map of beacons.
2. Once the map is created, I aim to use these beacons to locate the position of a phone and display that location on a 2D eagle-eye view map.

An example use case of this: A warehouse manager downloads the app. They use the app to locate and generate a map of beacons. Then, warehouse employees download the app. They activate the app when they come to work, so that their positions can be tracked on by the warehouse manager.
